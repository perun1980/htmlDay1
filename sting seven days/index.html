    <header><b>Seven days</b></header>
    <p><i> "Seven days" is all she wrote <br>
        A kind of ultimatum note <br>
        She gave to me <br>
        She gave to me <br>
        <p> When I thought the field had cleared <br>
        It seems another suit appeared <br>
        To challenge me <br>
        Oh, woe is me <br></p>
        <p> Though I hate to make a choice <br>
        My options are decreasing mostly rapidly <br>
        Well, we'll see <br></p>
        <p> I don't think she'd bluff this time <br>
        I really have to make her mine <br>
        It's plain to see <br>
        It's him or me <br></p>
        <p> Monday, I could wait 'til Tuesday <br>
        If I make up my mind <br>
        Wednesday would be fine <br>
        Thursday's on my mind <br>
        Friday'd give me time <br>
        Saturday could wait <br>
        Sunday'd be too late <br></p>
        <p> The fact he's over six feet ten <br>
        Might instill fear in other men <br>
        But not in me <br>
        The mighty flea <br></p>
        <p> Ask if I am mouse or man <br>
        The mirror squeaked, away I ran <br>
        He'll murder me <br>
        In time for his tea <br> </p>
        <p> Does it bother me at all <br>
        My rival is Neanderthal? <br>
        It makes me think, hey <br>
        Perhaps I need a drink <br>
        IQ is not an issue here <br>
        We won't be playing Scrabble <br>
        For her hand I fear <br>
        I need that beer, hey <br>
        Monday, I could wait 'til Tuesday <br>
        If I make up my mind <br>
        Wednesday would be fine <br>
        Thursday's on my mind <br>
        Friday'd give me time <br>
        Saturday could wait <br>
        Sunday'd be too late <br>
        Seven days will quickly go <br>
        The fact remains, I love her so (I love her so) <br>
        Seven days, so many ways <br>
        I can't run away <br>
        No, I can't run away <br>
        Monday, I could wait 'til Tuesday <br>
        If I make up my mind <br>
        Wednesday would be fine <br>
        Thursday's on my mind <br>
        Friday'd give me time <br>
        Saturday could wait <br> 
        Sunday'd be too late <br>
        Oh, Sunday <br>
        Sunday'd too late, too late <br>
        Too late, too late, oh <br>
        Do I have to tell the story <br>
        Of a thousand rainy days since we first met? <br>
        Oh! <br>
        It's a big enough umbrella <br>
        But it's always me that ends up getting wet <i></p></p>
