      <b>A Clockwork Orange</b> is a 1971 dystopian crime film adapted, produced, and
      directed by <i>Stanley Kubrick</i>, based on <i>Anthony Burgess's</i> 1962 novel of the
      same name. It employs disturbing, violent images to comment on psychiatry,
      juvenile delinquency, youth gangs, and other social, political, and
      economic subjects in a dystopian near-future Britain. Alex (Malcolm
      McDowell), the central character, is a charismatic, antisocial delinquent
      whose interests include classical music (especially <b><i>Beethoven</i></b> ), committing
      rape, theft, and what is termed "ultra-violence". He leads a small gang of
      thugs, Pete (Michael Tarn), Georgie (James Marcus), and Dim (Warren
      Clarke), whom he calls his droogs (from the Russian word друг, "friend",
      "buddy"). The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, his
      capture, and attempted rehabilitation via an experimental psychological
      conditioning technique (the "Ludovico Technique") promoted by the Minister
      of the Interior (Anthony Sharp). Alex narrates most of the film in Nadsat,
      a fractured adolescent slang composed of Slavic languages (especially
      Russian), English, and Cockney rhyming slang. The film premiered in New
      York City on 19 December 1971 and was released in the United Kingdom on 13
      January 1972. The film was met with polarised reviews from critics and was
      controversial due to its depictions of graphic violence. After it was
      cited as having inspired copycat acts of violence, the film was withdrawn
      from British cinemas at Kubrick's behest, and it was also banned in
      several other countries. In the years following, the film underwent a
      critical re-evaluation and gained a cult following. It received several
      awards and nominations, including four nominations at the 44th Academy
      Awards. In 2020, the significance of the film was recognised when it was
      selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by
      the Library of Congress.
